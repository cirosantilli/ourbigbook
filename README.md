# Cirodown

A Markup language to write multipage or single page HTML / PDF books, blogs, etc. that is saner and more powerful than Markdown and Asciidoctor, but still nicer to write than XML and JSON, with reference implementation in JavaScript.

The real README is of course [README.ciro](README.ciro)
