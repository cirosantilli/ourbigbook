OurBigBook is a powerful static wiki generator and lightweight markup language to write complex structured wikis/books/blogs.

The same markup source code can also be uploaded to [OurBigBook.com](https://OurBigBook.com) which has the amazing ["Topics" mindmelding magic feature](https://docs.ourbigbook.com/#ourbigbook-web-topics) ðŸ§™

The real README is of course [README.bigb](README.bigb)
