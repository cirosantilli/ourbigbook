= Includes not README

This file, surprisingly, includes \c[not-readme.ciro].

It is meant a more minimal interactive test of \x[include]{p} than the full blown \c[README.ciro].

Here are some internal cross references to the includes: \x[not-readme], \x[not-readme-2], \x[h2-in-not-the-readme].

And an internal cross reference to this file itself just in case: \x[includes-not-readme-h2].

== Includes not README h2

The includes follow here:

\Include[not-readme]

\Include[not-readme-2]

=== Includes not README h3

A header after the includes.
